## Project Description

This assignment folder contains C programs that focus on bit manipulation operations.

## Tasks

List of tasks to be completed for this assignment:

### Task 0: Binary to Uint

Write a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.

### Task 1: Print Binary

Write a function that prints the binary representation of a number.

### Task 2: Get Bit

Write a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.

### Task 3: Set Bit

Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.

### Task 4: Clear Bit

Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.

### Task 5: Flip Bits

Write a function that returns the number of bits to flip to get from one number to another.

## Compilation

Use the provided compilation commands to compile each task.

## Usage

To test each program, compile the corresponding main file along with the task file and the `_putchar.c` file (if needed).

### Example Compilation and Execution for Task 0:

```bash
gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 0-main.c 0-binary_to_uint.c -o a
./a

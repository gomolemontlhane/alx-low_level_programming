# 0x1C. C - Makefiles

This repository contains Makefiles for different tasks as part of the Makefiles project.

## Description

The project consists of several tasks, each requiring the creation of Makefiles to automate the compilation process of C source files and manage dependencies.

## Tasks

1. **Task 0:** Create a basic Makefile to compile and build an executable named "school".
2. **Task 1:** Modify the Makefile to use variables for the compiler and source files.
3. **Task 2:** Expand the Makefile to include variables for object files and the name of the executable.
4. **Task 3:** Enhance the Makefile with rules for cleaning object files and building the executable.
5. **Task 4:** Further improve the Makefile by adding compiler flags and additional cleaning rules.
6. **Task 5:** Implement a Python script to calculate the perimeter of an island described in a grid.

## Usage

Each task has its own Makefile and associated files. To compile and build the executable for a specific task, use the `make` command with the `-f` option followed by the corresponding Makefile.

For example:
```bash
make -f 0-Makefile
